      <h3>DevOps & Automation Engineering</h3>
      <p>DevOps is the practice of unifying development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to ensure a smooth and efficient software delivery process. Cloud engineering focuses on designing, building, and maintaining applications and systems on cloud platforms.</p>
      <p>Here's what excites me about these fields:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation: Automating repetitive tasks allows for faster deployment cycles and reduced human error.</li>
        <li>Scalability: Cloud platforms offer on-demand resources, enabling applications to scale up or down based on needs.</li>
        <li>Security: Devops prioritize security, offering robust features and best practices for building secure applications.</li>
      </ul>
